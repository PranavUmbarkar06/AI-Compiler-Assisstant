      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Lexer** | **Compile Regex Patterns** | If you are using Python's `re` module, compile all token-matching regular expressions using `re.compile()`. This pre-compiles the patterns into state machines, significantly speeding up the tokenization phase, especially for larger source files. |\n",
      "| **Lexer** | **Combine Token Matching** | Instead of running separate `re.match` checks for each token type, create a single master regex with named groups or use a tool like `re.finditer` over the entire source. This reduces overhead and is the standard practice for efficient lexing in Python. |\n",
      "| **Interpreter** | **Variable Lookup** | For the current global scope, the Python `dict` is already $O(1)$ on average for lookups, which is optimal. **No change is required.** This structure is fast and efficient for the current design. |\n",
      "| **Pythonic Refactor** | **Use Enums for Tokens** | Use Python's `enum.Enum` for defining your token types (e.g., `TokenType.PLUS`). This is more Pythonic, prevents typos, and allows for faster comparisons than using raw strings. |\n",

      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Declaration/Redeclaration** | Currently, `integer x = 5; integer x = 10;` is likely allowed, silently overwriting the variable. | **Parser/Interpreter Check:** During a `Declaration` statement, check the symbol table (your variable dictionary). If the identifier already exists, raise a `RedeclarationError`. |\n",
      "| **Type System Enforcement (Assignment)** | If extended, an assignment like `x = \"hello\";` could cause runtime errors, as `x` was declared as an integer. | **Interpreter Refactor:** Change the symbol table data structure from `{'x': 10}` to `{'x': {'type': 'integer', 'value': 10}}`. During an `Assignment` (`x = expr`), check that the result of `expr` is compatible with the stored `'type'`. |\n",
      "| **Ambiguity/Syntax** | Unary negation (e.g., `y = -5;`) can be ambiguous with binary subtraction (e.g., `y - 5;`). | **Parser Fix:** Ensure your `Factor` rule explicitly handles the unary minus operator (`-`) by giving it a higher precedence than binary operators. This typically involves checking for the minus sign token at the start of a `Factor`. |\n",
      "| **Division by Zero** | Any expression like `print(10 / 0);` will cause a standard Python runtime error. | **Interpreter Check:** During the handling of the `SLASH` operator, check the value of the right-hand operand. If it is zero, raise a custom `DivisionByZeroError` before the Python interpreter does. |\n",

      "| Component | Minimum Required Change |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Lexer** | Add tokens for `IF`, `LBRACE` (`{`), `RBRACE` (`}`), and relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.). |\n",
      "| **Parser** | Add a new non-terminal rule, `Condition`, which parses two expressions separated by a relational operator. Add a new `IfStatement` rule that consumes `IF`, parses a condition, and then parses a statement block (zero or more statements between `{}`). |\n",
      "| **Interpreter** | Implement logic for relational operators to return a Boolean value. The `IfStatement` handler will evaluate the condition. If true, it recursively calls the interpreter on the statement block; otherwise, it skips the block. |\n",

      "| **Lexer** | **None required**, assuming `STRING` and `PLUS` tokens already exist. |\n",
      "| **Parser** | **None required**, as the `PLUS` operator already exists in the `Expression` rule. The syntax is already supported; only semantics must change. |\n",
      "| **Interpreter** | In the handler for the `PLUS` operator, check the types of the two operands. If *at least one* is a string, implicitly convert the other operand to a string (if it's an integer) and perform string concatenation. If both are integers, perform integer addition as usual. |\n",

      "| Component | Minimum Required Change |\n",

      "| **Lexer** | Add a new regex pattern for comments (e.g., `//.*`). Crucially, modify the lexer logic so that when a `COMMENT` token is identified, it is **discarded** and *not* passed to the parser. |\n",
      "| **Parser** | **None required**, as the Lexer will filter out comment tokens entirely, meaning the parser never sees them. |\n",
      "| **Interpreter** | **None required**, for the same reason—no comment tokens reach the execution stage. |\n"
